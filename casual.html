    <h2>Casual Tournament</h2>
    <p>
      At Lancers HQ, we believe that dueling should be fun and accessible for
      everyone. That's why we host Casual Tournaments designed to bring together
      duelists of all skill levels in a relaxed, friendly environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tournaments are perfect for players who want to enjoy the thrill of
      competition without the pressure of high-stakes matches. Whether you're
      testing out a new deck, experimenting with strategies, or just looking to
      meet other Yu-Gi-Oh! fans, our casual tournaments offer the ideal setting.
